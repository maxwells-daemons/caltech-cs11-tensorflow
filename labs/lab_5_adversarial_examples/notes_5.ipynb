    "## Advanced optimizers\n",
    "SGD with momentum is a fairly good optimizer, but assumes that every parameter it's updating should have the same learning rate (and that the learning rate should stay the same over time).\n",
    "But, if a parameter contributes to a unit that activates often, it will more frequently receive strong gradient updates, and so have a higher \"effective learning rate\".\n",
    "Having parameters with very different \"effective learning rates\" slows down learning, since either units which infrequently activate will have very low effective learning rates and be slow to converge, or units which frequently activate will have too-high effective learning rates and will not converge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several advanced \"adaptive\" optimizers have been developed to deal with this problem.\n",
    "They have the additional advantage of working well with a broader range of learning rates than SGD, so they take less tuning.\n",
    "They're particularly effective when you expect certain features to be rare or sparse, since this is when differences in effective learning rate appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll only describe the basics of these algorithms here.\n",
    "If you're interested in reading more, check out [this post on ruder.io](http://ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/index.html).\n",
    "The [Keras documentation on optimizers](https://keras.io/optimizers/) also has some good info.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adagrad\n",
    "Adagrad is an adaptive variant of SGD that divides the learning rate applied to a given parameter by the square root of the running total of gradient updates that parameter has _ever_ seen.\n",
    "As training progresses, the learning rate of each parameter monotonically decreases as it experiences more gradient updates, and the parameters that are updated the most see the sharpest decrease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adagrad has the very appealing property that you basically don't need to tune the learning rate; the Keras documentation recommends leaving it fixed at 0.01.\n",
    "But this robustness comes with a major downside: the \"running total of past gradients\" it keeps track of per-parameter strictly grows, so eventually the learning rate becomes very small.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes Adagrad a bad choice for long-running training tasks.\n",
    "Qualitatively, I don't see Adagrad used very often.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use Adagrad in TensorFlow, use [`tf.train.AdagradOptimizer`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/train/AdagradOptimizer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### RMSProp and Adadelta\n",
    "Instead of reducing the learning rate for a parameter based on all of the updates it's ever gotten, RMSProp and Adadelta use an exponential moving average of previous gradients, so the reduction is based on only the previous few updates. \n",
    "This prevents Adagrad's problem of monotonically-decreasing gradients, but does make it more sensitive to learning rate tuning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of the two, RMSProp seems to be more popular, though there's not a lot of difference.\n",
    "RMSProp in particular is a very commonly-used optimizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use them, see [`tf.train.RMSPropOptimizer`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/train/RMSPropOptimizer) and [`tf.train.AdadeltaOptimizer`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/train/AdadeltaOptimizer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adam\n",
    "Adam is a modification of RMSProp with an extra term similar to momentum (using a moving average of past gradients instead of the current gradient).\n",
    "It's extremely popular, and usually trains your model the fastest with the least tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use it, see [`tf.train.AdamOptimizer`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/train/AdamOptimizer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple SGD generalizes better?\n",
    "Adaptive methods like Adam almost always converge faster much faster, but there is [some evidence that SGD + momentum](http://ruder.io/deep-learning-optimization-2017/index.html#improvingadam) generalizes better.\n",
    "Generally I stick to Adam, but when you need to squeeze accuracy out of a model (e.g. Kaggle) consider SGD + momentum instead of an adaptive method."

    "Ideally, each tensor represents exactly one thing.\n",

    "\n",
    "Recall from the discussion of backpropagation how the gradient applied to a parameter is the sum of gradients along all paths from that parameter to the output.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Passing variables to [`minimize()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/train/Optimizer#minimize)\n",
    "When calling the `minimize()` function of an optimizer, you can optionally specify `var_list`, a list of variables to be changed when that operation is evaluated.\n",

    "If you remove gradients and variables from the list returned by `compute_gradients()` before passing it to `apply_gradients()`, those variables will not be updated."
