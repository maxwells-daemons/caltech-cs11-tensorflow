    "# Nonlinear modeling\n",
    "Logistic regression and linear regression are linear models: the output variable (or the vector of logits, in logistic regression) is a linear combination of the input features.\n",
    "These models can model nonlinear terms in your data, including interactions between the features, but only if you design those terms by hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, nonlinear models such as neural networks can \"automatically\" discover interaction terms and nonlinear terms in the input.\n",
    "This lets them represent much more complicated functions, since most interesting problems involve terms too difficult to design by hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key distinguishing factor between different kinds of nonlinear models is how those terms are discovered.\n",
    "Very generic models, like RBF SVMs, can represent almost any kind of mapping from input to output, but as a result can't learn \"smart\" features because the only property they assume about the data is that similar inputs map to similar outputs (the \"local smoothness prior\").\n",
    "More \"opinionated\" models, like neural networks, learn a function from a smaller class but can learn more complicated relationships with less data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Aside: The \"no free lunch theorem of machine learning\"\n",
    "This theorem roughly says: no machine learning model strictly outperforms any other model on all problems.\n",
    "It's kind of controversial whether this really means anything: sure, you can pick a test set that has nothing to do with the input, and so random choice does better than even mean-fitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, the general idea is important for understanding why we'd chose one model over another.\n",
    "No model does better than any other on random functions.\n",
    "Instead, when picking a model, you need to think about what _properties of the real world_ the model does well on.\n",
    "For instance, if you expect classes to be well-separated, then an SVM is a good choice; if you expect neighborhood relationships to be more important, than K-nearest-neighbors might be a good fit.\n",
    "When thinking about models, think about what _priors_ they impose on the functions they learn.\n",
    "We'll justify neural networks by showing that they impose priors we'd reasonably expect problems in the real world to follow."

    "Fully-connected, feedforward neural networks are a special case of neural networks which use only fully-connected (or \"dense\") layers for their hidden layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dense layers\n",
    "A dense layer $L$ computes its output (or _activation_) as\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\vec{a_L} = f (W_L \\vec{a_{L-1}} + \\vec{b_L})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $W_L$ and $\\vec{b_L}$ are the layer's learned weight matrix and bias vector, $a_{L-1}$ is the activation of the previous layer (or is just the input, if $L = 1$), and $f(x)$ is an **activation function** which performs some (nonlinear) transformation on each element of the output vector.\n",
    "You can think of a dense layer with $n$ inputs and $m$ outputs as performing $m$ linear regressions, each from the same set of $n$ input variables, then applying the activation function to each. \n",
    "\n",
    "The activation function is important.\n",
    "A neural network with no activation function (or a linear activation function) is really just linear regression with more steps -- the matrices for each layer multiply together, and the entire network becomes $\\vec{y} = W \\vec{x} + \\vec{b}$, where $\\vec{y}$ is the output vector, $\\vec{x}$ is the vector of input features, and $W$ and $\\vec{b}$ are some weight matrix and bias vector.\n",
    "A network with nonlinear activation functions is instead able to learn to use those activation functions to \"bend\" its input space in the right places and approximate any function.\n",
    "\n",
    "$W$ and $b$ get learned through gradient descent and backpropagation, possible because every operation here is differentiable.\n",
    "So, it's important that the activation function is differentiable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output layer\n",
    "The last layer of a feedforward neural network takes the activations of the last hidden layer (the _final representation_) and uses it to produce the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "For regression, this is easy: just perform a linear regression from the final representation to the output.\n",
    "This is equivalent to a dense layer with a linear (identity) activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification, logistic regression is used instead of linear regression.\n",
    "Binary classification (\"Bernoulli output\") uses the logistic sigmoid as an activation function; classifying input into one of many classes (\"multinoulli output\") uses the softmax function.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a more thorough coverage, check out http://www.deeplearningbook.org/, chapter 6.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Aside: linear activations\n",
    "Using the identity function as an activation in hidden layers isn't actually totally meaningless.\n",
    "You replace the single matrix multiplication of a full linear regression from inputs to outputs with a product of matrices, which might together have fewer parameters than the single large matrix.\n",

    "Prior to deep learning, the dominant approach to machine learning was \"feature engineering\" -- designing features (interactions, nonlinear terms, etc) by hand with the assumption that some simple model of them (linear model, K-NN) will suffice to solve the problem. \n",
    "One way to think about neural networks is that they perform this process automatically, learning representations in their hidden layers and then fitting a simple model (linear regression or logistic regression) to the output data.\n",
    "Hidden layers are sometimes said to perform \"feature extraction\" in that they learn a good set of features for the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last layer is a linear model of the activation of the second-to-last layer, and so the set of hidden layers defines a nonlinear function from the input features to the final representation.\n",
    "We want this function to \"disentangle\" the input, so that a linear model is sufficient to perform the final step.\n",
    "The activations of hidden layers form \"representations\" of the input that contain the same important information, but discards noise and makes the information more easily accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is achieved with the backpropagation algorithm and gradient descent.\n",
    "The gradient of the loss function not only tells the last layer how it should change to fit the data better, but also how the previous layer should change such that the final layer does better. \n",
    " \n",
    "This same reasoning applies within hidden layers.\n",
    "The last hidden layer has the difficult task of giving the output layer a good enough representation to perform the task linearly.\n",
    "This task is easier if the last hidden layer itself has a good representation as input.\n",

    "That's why we use multiple hidden layers: because each one makes the next one's job easier.\n",

    "Wider networks learn a more rich representation per hidden layer, and deeper networks learn more representations so each can be simpler.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting: at every step, the hidden layers change so that their activations would make the _current_ version of the final layer do better.\n",

    "I mentioned before that a model is only as good as the priors it imposes, and how those line up with the real world.\n",

    "That is, the output pattern is easy to see if we frame the question in terms of the presence or absence of slightly simpler patterns.\n",
    "Those patterns are easier to find if we frame them in terms of yet simpler patterns, and so on.\n",

    "And those shapes are made up of common patterns in pixels, which is the input.\n",
    "Each hidden layer then ought to learn more and more abstract representations, in terms of composing simple patterns of lower-level layers.\n",

    "\n",
    "Is this prior reasonable?\n",

    "## Effects of depth and width\n",
    "#### Capacity\n",
    "Model capacity is first and foremost when deciding on how many layers a model should have (depth) and how many units each layer should have (width).\n",
    "Wider layers learn more complicated functions, and more layers means the network composes more functions; both lead to a higher-capacity model, less likely to underfit but more likely to overfit.\n",
    "Roughly, width adds more parameters than depth, since adding one unit to a layer adds a parameter for every output of the previous layer.\n",
    "Neural networks are usually only a good fit for problems where you have _lots_ of data, so modern architectures tend to be very large and high-capacity.\n",

    "\n",
    "More interesting than determining the number of parameters is the question of where those parameters should go (more layers vs wider layers).\n",
    "Generally, the modern understanding is that deeper networks are both more powerful (higher capacity) and generalize better in practice than networks that spend their parameters on width.\n",
    "This seems impossible from a [bias-variance tradeoff](http://scott.fortmann-roe.com/docs/BiasVariance.html) perspective!\n",
    "This effect is generally explained as: making a model \"deep and thin\" imposes a strong prior that the function it learns will be a composition of very many simple functions.\n",
    "This appears to be a good fit for many real-world problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "This point is illustrated in the experiment above (performed on a dataset of house address numbers), where Goodfellow et al. plot the test accuracy of a model against its number of parameters and layers, and find that shallow models are more prone to overfitting as they get wider.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of models with many layers distinguishes modern \"deep learning\" from earlier attempts at applying neural networks, which typically used one or two hidden layers.\n",
