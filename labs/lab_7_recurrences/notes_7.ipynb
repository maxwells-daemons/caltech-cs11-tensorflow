    "To borrow an example from [Chris Olah's excellent blog post on RNNs](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) (you should probably read this!), a neural network trained to predict the next word will have trouble filling in the blank in \"I grew up in France [ . . . ] I speak fluent  ____\" without memory.\n",
    "If it takes a fixed-size window as input, it may predict that the next word is the name of a language, but if the first sentence comes much earlier in the text, it would need to guess which language.\n",

    "Another problem is how to deal with variable-length sequences.\n",
    "1-D convolution is possible on a variable-length sequence, producing another variable-length sequence, but if we want to \"sum up\" an entire sequence as a single vector or number (for example, classifying a sentence by content), it's unclear how to do that.\n",

    "There's a huge problem with simple RNNs limiting their modeling power: they have a very hard time learning long-term dependencies (for example, learning how the first word in a sentence interacts with the last word).\n",
    "This is because the interaction between the input in timestep $t_1$, $x_{t_1}$, and the hidden state in timestep $t_2 >> t_1$, $h_{t_2}$, involves passing through many hidden states. \n",
    "When doing backpropagation through time, this means that these terms are the result of many matrix multiplications and passes through the tanh function.\n",

    "Ignoring the activation function for a moment (somewhat reasonable since the tanh function looks linear for inputs near zero), these longterm interactions look like raising the hidden-hidden matrix to a high power ($t_2 - t_1$) and multiplying it by the hidden state at time $t_1$, $h_{t_1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is similar to the [power iteration algorithm in linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_iteration), with similar results: components of $h_{t_1}$ that are not aligned  with the largest eigenvector of $W$ decay to zero, and those that are explode to very high values.\n",
    "Both of these effects happen exponentially fast.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Gradient clipping\n",
    "Exploding gradients are rare relative to vanishing gradients, but when they occur, gradient descent can cause the network parameters to make a large jump instead of a small step, and the optimizer needs to restart minimizing the loss from scratch.\n",
    "Luckily, this has a simple and effective fix: **gradient clipping**, in which gradient updates of above a certain magnitude are \"clipped\" down to that magnitude, preventing large parameter jumps.\n",
    "There are principled ways of picking the magnitude to clip at, but in practice 1 works well.\n",
