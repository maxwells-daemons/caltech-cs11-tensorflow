    "TensorFlow is a library (usually used with Python) developed by Google Brain for training and running statistical machine learning models.\n",
    "It is extremely flexible, making almost no assumptions about your model except that you can represent it as a graph of math operations.\n",
    "As a result, it sees lots of use in developing new machine learning models, as well as efficiently training and running existing models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of TensorFlow over other frameworks:\n",
    " - Most flexible by far -- can use basically any differentiable equation as a model\n",
    " - Most popular and heavily-developed framework by far, used by numerous companies\n",
    " - Works well with CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs (Tensor Processsing Units), and across lots of devices, including distributed training\n",
    " - Incredible debugging and visualization utilities (TensorBoard and tfdbg)\n",
    " - Graph compilation can optimize your code for you\n",
    " - Gives you lots of control over hardware (e.g. whether variables live in CPU or GPU memory)\n",
    " - Open-source!\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    " - Graph programming unfamiliar to many people\n",
    " - Hard to search documentation, lots of deprecated and soon-to-be-deprecated APIs (with TensorFlow 2.0, this will hopefully change)\n",
    " - Generally more verbose and difficult to develop models (but we will also learn Keras, a library meant to make building common models in TensorFlow very simple)\n",
    " - Can be slower than other frameworks for certain models (Apache MXNET)\n",
    " - TensorFlow itself doesn't support every kind of statistical model, most notably \"graphical models\" associated with Bayesian statistics (although, see [bayesflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/bayesflow)) "

    "# Tensors and tensor values\n",
    "To do machine learning, you _really_ need to understand tensors and the terminology surrounding them.\n",
    "You can (for machine learning, at least) think of tensors as multidimensional arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "![tensors](./images/tensors_diagram.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "In TensorFlow, `tf.Tensor` objects act as \"placeholders\" (more on this later) for _tensor values_, which are numpy arrays.\n",
    "I'll try to stick to the notation **\"tensor\"** to mean `tf.Tensor` objects and **\"tensor value\"** to mean a multidimensional numpy array.\n",
    "The terminology around tensors and tensor values is the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "A tensor consists of a number of **scalars** organized in some \"rectangular\" way.\n",
    "Scalars have a [**data type**](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/dtypes/DType), usually a real floating-point number (`tf.float32`), integer (`tf.int32`), or boolean (`tf.bool`).\n",
    "To access a particular scalar in a tensor, provide an index in each of its **axes** (also called **dimensions**).\n",
    "The total number of axes a tensor has is its **rank**, and each axis has a fixed **size** which determines how many sub-tensors (of rank one less than the parent) you can get by indexing into just that axis.\n",
    "The total number of scalars a tensor can hold is the product of the sizes of its axes (unless it's rank-zero, then it holds a single value).\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the \"size\" properties of a tensor are encapsulated by its **shape**, which fully specifies how many axes it has, what order they come in, and what their sizes are.\n",
    "A tensor's shape is given by a tuple.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    " - a tensor with shape (3) is a vector (rank-1 tensor) with 3 elements\n",
    " - a tensor with shape (3, 4) is a matrix (rank-2 tensor) with 3 rows and 4 columns\n",
    " - a tensor with shape () is a scalar (rank-0 tensor; you need no indices to uniquely identify its only element)\n",
    " - a tensor with shape (2, 2, 2) (rank-3 tensor) is a 2x2x2 \"data cube\"\n",
    " - a tensor with shape (3, 1) is a matrix (rank-2 tensor) with 3 rows and 1 column; subtle difference from having shape (3)\n",
    " \n",
    "When you provide an index for $n$ axes of a rank-$r$ tensor, you get back a tensor with rank $r - n$, and a shape the same as the original but with the indexed axes removed.\n",
    "Numpy and TensorFlow have roughly the same notation for indexing into tensors to obtain sub-tensors.\n",
    "Similarly, some operations called **reductions** operate across one or more axes of a tensor, collapsing those axes into a scalar summarizing their elements.\n",
    "For instance, `tf.reduce_sum` applied to every axis of a tensor outputs a scalar equal to the sum of its scalars.\n",
    "`tf.reduce_mean` applied to axis 0 of a rank-2 tensor returns a vector that, for each column, contains a scalar of the mean of all of the rows in that column. \n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix transposition (which swaps the rows and columns of a matrix) has a natural extension to tensors: it just reorders their axes.\n",
    "You can \"reshape\" a tensor into a _compatible_ shape, which is to say one where the total number of scalars remains the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "I highly recommend understanding numpy indexing, including some of the advanced stuff you can do (like broadcasting, masking, and `np.where`) since a lot of this transfers to TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a good guide to numpy indexing, read https://realpython.com/numpy-array-programming/.\n",

    "Gradient descent is only guaranteed to converge to the global minimum of a _convex_ function.\n",
    "This seems like a problem, since most loss functions we want to minimize are not convex.\n",
    "However, local minima are very rare in high-dimensional space: for a random function to be at a local minimum in $n$-dimensional space, it needs to curve upwards on _every_ axis, so it has probability $\\propto 2^{-n}$.\n",
    "For neural networks, the vector space of possible parameter values can have millions of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we usually care about _saddle points_, where the loss function looks locally flat.\n",
    "Modern variants of gradient descent like momentum, adagrad, and Adam approach this problem by using more information than just the gradient to make parameter updates.\n",
    "But, how to handle these points best when training neural networks (and even how much of a problem they are) is still somewhat of an open problem."

    " 2. Using a `tf.Session` to evaluate tensors or operations by executing subgraphs\n",
    "\n",
    "## The graph\n",
    "Your code is written in Python, but most of your program logic will be in a computational graph.\n",
    "TensorFlow represents this with a `tf.Graph` object.\n",
    "TensorFlow always has a default `Graph`, and while it does support programs with multiple graphs, this usecase is rare and bug-prone.\n",
    "As a result, you'll basically never create `Graph`s by hand -- they'll just store your program in the background.\n",
    "If you do need to access the `Graph` object (for instance, to pass to the `add_graph()` method of a `FileWriter`), use `tf.get_default_graph()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tensors and operations\n",
    "To build up a computational graph, you need to add tensors (directed edges) and operations (nodes) to the `Graph`.\n",
    "Operations are represented by `tf.Operation` objects, and tensors are represented by `tf.Tensor` objects.\n",
    "Most functions in TensorFlow are actually `tf.Operation` constructors, which:\n",
    " - Take zero or more tensors, and possibly some parameters, as input\n",
    " - Permanently add a new operation to the `Graph`\n",
    " - Add a directed edge from each operation that created an input tensor to the new operation\n",
    " - Return a new `tf.Tensor` object (some operations do not return a tensor)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example (quoting the [official docs on `tf.Operation`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/Operation)), `c = tf.matmul(a, b)` creates an `Operation` of type \"MatMul\" that takes tensors `a` and `b` as input, and produces `c` as output.\n",
    "Passing `c` to another operation \"wires\" the two together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Always keep in mind that `tf.Tensor` objects are not tensor values, they're _just Python objects you use to build a graph!_\n",
    "You can only do two things with them: pass them to operations to wire operations together in the graph, or evaluate them with the `run()` method of a `tf.Session` (see below).\n",
    "Tensors do not have values until a subgraph they're in is actually evaluated.\n",
    "So printing the `tf.Tensor` object with Python's `print()` will do nothing -- use the `tf.print()` operation instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operations always accept a `name` keyword argument, which will give a name to the operation added to the graph and to the tensor it returns, if applicable.\n",
    "You should always name your important operations!\n",
    "It's good documentation for your code, and will make debugging with TensorBoard and tfdbg _infinitely_ easier.\n",
    "Think of operation naming like commenting: a little thing that will make debugging, maintainence, and development much easier. \n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest operation is [`tf.constant()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/constant), which just represents a constant value used in the graph.\n",
    "But think through how it works internally: calling `tf.constant()` actually adds a \"Constant\" operation to the graph and returns a tensor, which is still just a placeholder despite taking on the same value every time.\n",
    "Using this constant tensor means adding a directed edge from the \"Constant\" operation to wherever the constant tensor is used.\n",
    "Thinking about the internals in depth like this can prevent bugs, like the common mistake of calling an operation constructor each time you want to use its returned tensor -- this will add the same operation to the graph many times, when in fact you should store its returned tensor as a Python variable and use it to wire the operation's output to many other places.\n",
    "\n",
    "A very similar operation is [`tf.placeholder`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/placeholder), which takes a data type and a shape to return a single tensor.\n",
    "This tensor, when evaluated as part of a subgraph, will always error unleess fed (see the next section).\n",
    "Placeholders are often used for debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: almost any time you would use a tensor, you can instead use a [\"tensor-like object\"](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/graphs#tensor-like_objects): a numpy `ndarray`, a Python list, or a Python scalar.\n",
    "This will just act like a constant with the given value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note 2: \"operation constructors\" aren't actually legal Python constructors, but they're wrappers to constructors for subclasses of `tf.Operation` that return different objects\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sessions and subgraph execution\n",
    "A `tf.Session` object abstracts the entire context of running code: it owns access to hardware compute and IO devices (both local and remote), contains various settings, and manages access into the TensorFlow runtime (which is language-agnostic), including automatic parallelization.\n",
    "A session is associated with only one graph, though multiple sessions can be associated with the same graph (and often you use separate sessions for training and inference, for example).\n",
    "To create a session, call the `tf.Session()` constructor, remembering to call its `close()` method when you are done to free resources.\n",
    "Or, more conveniently (and Pythonically), use it in a `with` block:\n",
    "```\n",
    "with tf.Session() as sess:\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a session, you can finally execute your program by evaluating parts of the graph you've built with the [`run()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/Session#run) method of a `tf.Session`, which takes:\n",
    " - **fetches**: one or more tensors (which will be evaluated into numpy `ndarray`s of numbers) or operations (which will be run)\n",
    " - (optional) **feed_dict**: a dictionary of \"feeds\" mapping from tensor object to tensor value, which will overwrite the value of the tensor during the run; typically used with placeholders, but can overwrite any tensor; great for debugging!\n",
    " - (optional) **options**: [advanced options modifying the run](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/RunOptions)\n",
    " - (optional) **run_metadata**: a `tf.RunMetadata()` object to store information about the run in so it can be visualized later\n",
    "`run()` then recursively evaluates the operations required to compute each tensor or run each operation, and returns the tensor values (and None for each operation).\n",
    "Fetches can be passed as any combination of single values, lists, tuples, and dictionaries; values are returned in the same shape.\n",

    "## Variables\n",
    "To train a model, you need parameters that persist changes across multiple runs.\n",
    "These are represented by [`tf.Variable` objects](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/variables), which can be treated as a `tf.Tensor`.\n",
    "You can use the [`tf.Variable`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/Variable) constructor, but it's almost always moree convenient to use the [`tf.get_variable()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/get_variable) wrapper function, which gets an existing variable by string name or creates it if one does not exist.\n",
    "In addition to a name, a new variable needs a shape and an initializer.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Initializers](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/initializers) determine how a variable's value begins the first time it is used.\n",
    "What you plan a variable to represent will determine how you want it initialized.\n",
    "Then, before you run any of the graph code, call `sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())` to initialize all variables at once, or `sess.run(my_variable.initializer)` to initialize `my_variable` (less common).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that variables persist their value _only within the context of a single session!_\n",
    "To use variables over multiple sessions, save their values to disk with a Saver (see next lecture).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can change variables by hand, but usually they're changed with optimizers that use gradient descent (see next section) to find good values automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `tf.layers` API is a series of operations that contain their own variables.\n",
    "They help for certain simpler models, but are generally less flexible than managing the variables yourself.\n",
    "As a result we won't use any operations named like `tf.layers.*`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth reading the [short official Variables guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optimizers\n",
    "[Optimizers](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/train/Optimizer) automatically change variables in the graph to find values that minimze certain quantities, usually the loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "The archetypal optimizer is [`tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/train/GradientDescentOptimizer), and just about every other optimizer you use will be some variant of it.\n",
    "Optimizers are just Python objects, created through their constructors with some (optional or mandatory) parameters:\n",
    "```\n",
    "optimizer = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(learning_rate=0.01)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then, calling the optimizer's [`minimize()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/train/Optimizer#minimize) function, passing in the tensor containing the value to minimize, returns on operation.\n",
    "When this operation is run within a session, all of the variables in the same graph as the minimization operation are updated by the optimizer according to its optimization algorithm (gradient descent or a variant).\n",
    "Usually this happens many times in a \"training loop.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "training_op = optimizer.minimize(loss_tensor)\n",
    "with tf.Session() as sess:\n",

    "        sess.run(training_op)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: we haven't actually talked about backpropagation, the algorithm TensorFlow uses to efficiently compute gradients of values in the graph with respect to variables. More on this next week.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Name scopes and variable scopes\n",
    "In addition to giving single operations names, you can also use `tf.name_scope()` to give all following operations a common prefix.\n",
    "This is very helpful to group operations that form a \"block\" (and you can think of them as forming one, more complex, operation defined in terms of its inputs and outputs), and will also allow you to collapse them into a single node when visualizing the graph (next week).\n",
    "\n",
    "`tf.variable_scope()` is similar, except it affects the names of variables instead of the names of operations.\n",
    "You can also pass the keyword phrase `reuse=True` to a `tf.variable_scope()` to get a variable by the given name if it exists; otherwise TensorFlow will just throw an error."
